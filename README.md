# Composer template for Drupal projects

This project is a fork from the original [drupal-composer/drupal-project](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project)

Read the README.md form drupal-composer/drupal-project.

It aims to offer from this point a more evolved boiler-plate by making choice about basic modules, theme solutions I barely always use in projects in order to have a quick start kit for my projects.
